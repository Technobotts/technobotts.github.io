	We have been the UK RoboCup Junior Soccer champions for two years running,
	and went to Singapore to represent the UK in RoboCup in 2010. Previously, we
	travelled to Atlanta in 2007 and 2009 to compete in First Lego League (FLL).

	This year, after doing even better in the 2011 UK final (we scored 28 goals in
	the 2011 UK final and let no goals in), we will be travelling to Istanbul to
	represent the UK in RoboCup 2011. You can find information this year's robots
