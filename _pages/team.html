<h2>Members</h2>
<p>
The TechnoBotts robotics team consists of 2 people, and a coach. The team members are Andrew and Eric. Eric does most of the programming, and Andrew does most of the robot building.
</p>
<p>
Our coach is called Catherine. She is Andrew's mother, and has greatly helped us by organising the team, and supplying Jaffa Cakes at regular intervals.
