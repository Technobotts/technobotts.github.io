Found out last night that the hotel we had originally booked in was over-full due to an administrative error, so we were going to be switched from the original 4* hotel to a 5* hotel with better transportation links to the venue. So I rearranged the airport transfer to get Andrew and I taken to the new hotel and was about to confirm that yes, we could move to that hotel, no problem, when I received another email saying that they were going to switch us to yet another hotel instead.

I attempted to contact the airport transfer firm again, but have not yet heard from them, and in the meantime emailed the RoboCup accommodation office saying that yes, we probably could move again if necessary, but we really did need a definite confirmation of where we were going to be as soon as possible so that we could arrange our airport transfer. So weâ€™re back in the 5* hotel with the pool, and now I can plan our assault on the Istanbul public transport network to collect Eric from Taksim Square when he arrives on Wednesday.
