Today the team had the 3 robot runs in the Georgia Dome. First run – 370 points, which was enough to put us in first place for a while! It was a good feeling seeing Technobotts3 at the very top of the scoreboard.

Second run – we did it – a perfect score! 400 points!

Third run – 365 points. (would have been 380 points but the table ref decided to object to our yellow ball delivery strategy, where the team uses it as the ball caster for the robot, which none of the other refs had objected to.)

We’ve ended up in 4th place in robot performance overall. There were other 400 point scores – by teams from Brazil, China and Singapore – and their second highest scores were higher than our second highest score. Highest US score was 395.

The team had LOTS of visits from the technical judges today, both at the competition tables and in the pit area.

Awards ceremony is at 9am tomorrow morning in the Omni Hotel ballroom – we’ll be going along with our hats, t-shirts and team banner and keeping everything crossed – we would dearly love to bring a trophy back to the UK.

Tonight we’re off to the Georgia Aquarium.
