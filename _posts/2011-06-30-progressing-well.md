One robot completed today. Hardware finished; some programming still required.

It goes significantly faster than last year’s Lego robots, and it can see the ball and move towards it. Now the code needs tweaking to integrate the compass sensor readings and the ultrasonic sensor readings so that it can take the ball towards the goal without driving into the walls.

I am so proud of the team for what they have achieved so far. It’s been a huge learning curve, and I’ve leant on them pretty hard in recent weeks to get things moving and achieve a working robot. But I am absolutely staggered by what they have achieved – every bit of this robot has been designed and built – from the wheels up – by the boys. It’s a lot harder and more expensive doing it with components and choosing the sensors, etc, than it is with Lego. However they have risen to the challenge.
