TechnoBotts³ came 4th out of 84 robots in robot performance, so narrowly missed a trophy there (there were trophies for first, second and third, won by Brazil, Singapore and China respectively- no US robots achieved a 400-point run at the FIRST World Festival, but 4 foreign teams did!), BUT we won the 1st place for Innovative Design trophy! So we’re all really thrilled about that.

The boys are currently cooling off in the hotel pool at present – we’ll be off to lunch at a fancy restaurant next to celebrate the trophy win, and later on today it’s the FIRST Finale – a big party in Centennial Olympic Park, which we’re all looking forward to hugely.
