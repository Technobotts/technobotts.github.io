title: Starting to assemble the bits…

Over the last week or so, at TechnoBotts HQ, various packages have been arriving containing bits of the new robots. We now have most of the parts that we need, except for the wheels and the chassis, crucial bits for which will be ordered very soon.

Today Eric is here, and he and Andrew are testing the microcontroller and getting it to work with the infra-red sensors and the infra-red-emitting soccer ball. I’ve just ordered another IR ball from www.hitechnic.com, as last year we had a problem between the UK finals and the international competition with our ball suddenly dying unexpectedly, and so having a spare one in hand is a useful safety strategy.

We have had some excellent news this week – ELRIG, our major sponsors last year, have kindly agreed to sponsor us this year as well, which is great, and we have had some indications of probable support from another couple of companies as well. In addition, we are talking to various journalists so there should be some articles about the team coming out soon. So it’s starting to feel like we’re really on the way now. A few people have also asked how they can sponsor us, which was very kind of them, so we are thinking of putting a PayPal button on our [Sponsors](/sponsors) page.
